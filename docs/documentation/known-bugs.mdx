---

## Data Consistency
> While not technically a bug, our goal is to match the data for each Pok√©mon found in [Radical Red Dex](https://dex.radicalred.net/). We made a large effort to address all inconsistencies in version 1.2, but some may remain (especially learnset data). Please report any inconsistencies not documented as intentional deviations.

## Barb Barrage
- Currently only does double damage to a Pok√©mon that is poisoned.
- In Radical Red, it does double damage to a Pok√©mon with *any* status.
- This functionality was not correctly ported to EI, so it only does double damage to a poisoned Pok√©mon.

## Mr. Briney Disappearance
- Mr. Briney can disappear if you travel from Dewford back to the mainland or Slateport and lose a battle in some scenarios.
- **Tip:** Save often when at Dewford Town until fixed.

## Supercell Slam & Lightning Rod
- Supercell Slam into a Pok√©mon with Lightning Rod (or with Lightning Rod on the field) does not cause the crash damage for missing.

## Chatot Ability
- Chatot's ability was not changed to Punk Rock, which is notable for Cooltrainer Michelle.

## Pawkkie‚Äôs Wall
- There is a spider on Pawkkie‚Äôs wall.
