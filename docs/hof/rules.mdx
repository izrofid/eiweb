## General Rules

### 1.0 Fainting
If a Pokémon faints, it is considered dead and must be **released** or placed in a **death box** in the PC, from which it may not be removed.

### 2.0 Encounters
You may only attempt to catch the **first Pokémon** you encounter on each route.  
If you KO it, run out of Pokéballs, or flee the battle, the encounter is **forfeit**.

#### 2.1 Shiny Clause
If you encounter a **Shiny Pokémon**, you may catch and use it **even if** you've already had an encounter on that route. Shinies are fun!		
You may not intentionally Shiny hunt.

#### 2.2 Species Duplicates Clause
If your encounter is from the **same evolutionary line** as a Pokémon you already possess, it is considered a duplicate.  
You may **skip it and take the next** encounter on that route.

#### 2.3 Clarification
Refer to figure `2.3a` for which Pokémon are considered duplicates.

### 3.0 Livestream Requirement
Your entire winning run must be **livestreamed**, with **all VODs publicly viewable** for verification.  
Due to Twitch's VOD limits, uploading to **YouTube** is recommended.

#### 3.1 Boss Fight Transparency
Before each major battle (Gym, Boss, Rival, etc.), you must show your **party stats, abilities, moves, and held items** on stream.

### 4.0 No Exploits
You may not use **external tools or glitches** to break the game (e.g., exceeding level caps, skipping bosses, acquiring early items, etc.).

### 5.0 Required Game Settings
You must play on:
- **Normal Difficulty**
- **Minimal Grinding Mode** enabled
- **Set Mode**
- **No Randomization**
- Version **1.2 or later**

Runs started before 3/11/2025 are **not valid**.

### 6.0 No Resets for Trainers
You must not reset if you accidentally engage a trainer or boss fight.  
Optional trainers **may not be dodged** if encountered.

#### 6.1 Post-Battle Proof
If a boss battle starts without a pre-fight team reveal (per rule 3.1), you must show **stats and items immediately after** the battle.

### 7.0 No Resetting for Team RNG
You may not reset for desired trainer teams (e.g., Elite Four 50/50 variations).

### 8.0 Cheat Code Restrictions
Only the following codes are allowed:
- `DexAll`
- `ShinyS`

#### 8.1 DexAll Usage
You may use DexAll and the DexNav to **verify location-based encounters**, but not to initiate one.

#### 8.2 Roamer Tracking
“CaughtAll” is **not needed or allowed** for tracking roamers (added in 1.2).

#### 8.3 No EZCatch
The “EZCatch” cheat is **not allowed**.
